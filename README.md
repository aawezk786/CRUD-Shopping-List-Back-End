A simple Angular CRUD project which adds a shopping list where you can add, delete, and modify things you've added to your shopping list. Also, you need to start CRUD-Shopping-List-Front-End code, so be sure to clone that repo as well.

SETUP :

1. Clone the repo.

2. cd into project.

3. Do `npm install`.

4. Be sure to run MongoDB in the background. If you don't have MongoDB installed, check their official website on how to do it properly.

5. Hit `npm start`.

Enjoy!
